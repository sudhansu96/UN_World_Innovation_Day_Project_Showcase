# UN_World_Innovation_Day_Project_Showcase
+The repository consists of three codes that serve the digital image and video analysis of our setup "CARBON CAPTURE USING VACUUM CLEANER" along with working video,technical paper and 2 images that we have analysed:<br />

+-<b>Image_to_Text:</b> The code convert the .bmp files of the angular view and internal_structure_view to .txt format containing binary data. Each 8 characters corresponds to the character byte when the image is opened using a text editor <br />

+-<b>Text_to_Image:</b> The code converts the .txt files of the angular view and internal_structure_view to .bmp format  with the image file full of binary characters, i.e. a text file with only ones and zeroes.

+-<b>Working of setup:/b> It is a matlab script that dynamically shows the working of our setup
+-<b>Working of setup.avi:</b> It is the video file showing the working of our setup
+-<b>CARBON CAPTURE USING VACUUM CLEANER-TECHNICAL PAPER.docx:</b>  It is the technical paper depicticting the project description in detail
+-<b>angular view.bmp:</b> It shows the angular view of the computer aided design model of our setup
+-<b>internal_structure_view.bmp:</b> It shows the full internal structure what components are there in our setup
